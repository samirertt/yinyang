# Yinyang Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
To ensure that your Spring Boot application runs smoothly, make sure you have the following installed:

### 1. Java 23
- Verify your Java version by running:

  java -version

- If Java 23 is not installed, download and install it from [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use an OpenJDK distribution.

### 2. MySQL
- Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
- Verify by running:

  mysql --version

- If MySQL is not installed, download it from [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).
- Create a database for your application using the script in the "SQL" folder:

  CREATE DATABASE yinyang;

  Update your `application.properties` file with the appropriate database connection settings.

## Running the Project

### 1. Build and Run the Application
#### **With Terminal:**
Navigate to the backend folder and build the project:

cd Backend
./gradlew build

Run the application:

./gradlew bootRun

#### **Without Terminal:**
- Open the project in an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
- Locate `build.gradle` under the Backend folder and run it.
- Navigate to `BackendApplication.java` inside `src/main` and run it.

### 3. Adding Dependencies
#### **With Terminal:**
Edit `build.gradle`, then run:

./gradlew build

#### **Without Terminal:**
- Open `build.gradle` in your IDE.
- Add dependencies under the `dependencies` section.
- Click **Reload Gradle Project** in the IDE.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Java Version Issues
Check which Java version Gradle is using:

./gradlew -version

If incorrect, update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

### 2. MySQL Connection Errors
- Ensure MySQL is running (`mysql.server start` or via Workbench).
- Check `application.properties` for correct database credentials.

### 3. Gradle Build Issues
If the build fails, try:

./gradlew clean
./gradlew build

If it fails to clean manually delete the build folder and rebuild the project

Now, you're all set! Enjoy yinyang
